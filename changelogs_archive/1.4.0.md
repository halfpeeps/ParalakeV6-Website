This build doesn't change anything over the previous full release, but contains business as it was when merged into the main map 3 days ago.
Note cubemaps were not built for this release as it is identical to 1.3.8 for all areas except business.  You can build cubemaps yourself by entering the following commands into your console:

```
buildingcubemaps 1
buildcubemaps
```

I've now started work on business so expect new releases with updates in the coming weeks.

(You do not need to provide feedback for business in its current state, this is just so there is an up to date full build)
