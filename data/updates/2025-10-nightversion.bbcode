[B][SIZE=2]Explore Paralake V6 in a whole new light (literally).  Experience the city and surrounding districts long after dark, just following a brief rain shower.  Glowing lights, reflections in the streets, and spooky dark forests.  Check out Paralake City reworked for night time atmosphere.[/SIZE][/B]

This is night time as it's meant to look.  It's well known that the day night cycle on the server does not always create the best night time effect, but now, with this version designed specifically for the dark, you can see just what Paralake looks like once the sun has set.  Changes include:
[LIST]
[*]A complete rework of the map's lighting to create the best atmosphere for night
[*]Updated soundscapes to reflect the change in time
[*]Updates to many textures, creating the effect that it has just been raining
[*]New additional particles and effects to enhance the atmosphere and ambience
