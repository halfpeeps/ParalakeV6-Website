[B][SIZE=7]Realtor UI Overhaul[/SIZE][/B]
<br>
<br>
The Realtor UI at the bank has been completely redesigned. The old version was outdated, so we’ve rebuilt it from the ground up with a modern look and improved functionality.
The new interface provides a cleaner design and much more information about available properties.
<br>
<br>

<br>
[B][SIZE=7]CPR changes[/SIZE][/B]
<br>
<br>
We’ve expanded the CPR mechanic. Previously, only Firefighters could use it, but now civilians will also have access, though at half the efficiency of Firefighters. There are some rank requirements and benefits:
[LIST]
[*]To use CPR as a civilian, you must hold [B]at least[/B] one of the following ranks: [B]Specialist Paramedic[/B] or [B]Advanced Firefighter[/B].
[*]To gain a small chance of reviving a player as a civilian, you [B]must hold at least[/B] the rank of [B]Specialist Firefighter[/B].
[*]Higher ranks also inherit these abilities.
[/LIST]
These requirements and mechanic may be adjusted in the future for balance.
<br>
<br>
[B][SIZE=7]Firefighter changes[/SIZE][/B]
<br>
<br>
The Firefighter role hasn’t received much attention in a while, so we spent some time fixing long-standing issues and making a few quality-of-life improvements. Thanks to [USER=349]@Creepis[/USER] for the help.
[LIST]
[*]Barricades are now available to all Firefighter ranks.
[*]Advanced Firefighter and higher can now see the exact time a player has left before dying.
[*]XP gains have been increased across all Firefighter activities.
[*]Money and XP from extinguishing fires will now be shared with nearby Firefighters.
[*]Drastically lowered hose sound
[/LIST]
<br>
These changes should make the job smoother to play and less of a grind.
