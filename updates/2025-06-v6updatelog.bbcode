[B][SIZE=5]Update Log - 28/06/2025[/SIZE][/B]<br>
[/CENTER]
After years of development, I am excited to finally be able to share with you the that Paralake V6 is now live on the server and the [URL='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3510652177']Steam Workshop[/URL].  Today's update log will go over some of the changes in the map, as well as other gamemode updates both V6 related, and unrelated.  Before diving into that, a quick thank you to everyone who has helped with V6.  From those on the development team, the admins who have worked on updating the guides, and the many playtesters, who have kept the map a secret since last November despite probably quite a lot of temptation to talk about it.  It's been a group effort, especially in the final few months, and we wouldn't have reached this point without everyone who contributed.  You can find the full map credits [URL='https://www.paralakev6.com/credits.html']here[/URL].

<br>
[B][SIZE=7]New Map Information[/SIZE][/B]<br>
I don't want to spoil too much of the new map, as part of the fun will be exploring it, but I will go over some important bits that will help you find your way.  Like in previous versions, the map is split into 4 districts; City, Suburbs, Forest and Business.
<br>
<br>

<br>
[B][SIZE=5]Properties[/SIZE][/B]<br>

<br>
<br>
[B][SIZE=5]Shops[/SIZE][/B]<br>
Many of the old NPC shops have been replaced with new brands.  Most of them have also been moved to spawn making it easier to grab everything you need from one place.  Here is an updated list to help you find what you're looking for:<br>
[LIST]
[*][B]Lucia's Clothing Store[/B] - A clothing shop where you can customise the style of your character

<br>
<br>
[B][SIZE=5]The Paralake City Metro[/SIZE][/B]<br>
Replacing the Monorail is the new Paralake City Metro.  It is the fastest way to get around the map, with stations in the City, Suburbs and Business districts.  Look for the overground Metro stand and make your way down the stairs into the station in order to board a train.  There are 2 lines, running every 90 seconds.
<br>
<br>

That should be everything you need to know before you start exploring Paralake V6.  If you get stuck you can find lots more information in the new updated guides over on [URL='https://help.perpheads.com/']help.perpheads.com[/URL]

If you are having issues with conficting content, be sure to unsubscribe from Paralake V5 and other previous versions.  Given that this is a new map, bugs and issues are expected.  Please report any bugs you find [URL='https://perpheads.com/forums/bug-reports.345/']here[/URL].

<br>
[B][SIZE=7]Adverts & Billboards[/SIZE][/B]<br>
A major change we have made is to the advert system.  To cut down on bad adverts, we have removed the ability to use /advert.  In order to place an advert now, you must head to one of two locations on the map; the Paralake News Building in the City, or the PLN News Stand in the Business District.  From these locations you will be able to either place a single advert, or schedule a set of repeating adverts to go out over a specified period of time.
<br>
<br>
[SPOILER="PLN Building and News Stand"]

[SPOILER="Advert Menu"][IMG size="420x447"]https://files.perpheads.com/uZJUeRwDH2JjV3Tt.jpg[/IMG][/SPOILER]<br>
Similar to adverts, Billboards have also moved.  You can now hire billboards at the Paralake News Building instead of the Bank.  You can also now purchase horrizontal billboards as well as vertical ones.

<br>
<br>
[B][SIZE=7]Robbing the Bank[/SIZE][/B]<br>
With V6, XQ Bank and the surrounding area has been remade from scratch. Along with this some changes have been made to how the bank robbery works. We hope this will bring some new gameplay opportunities while feeling more balanced and being less disruptive to the City. This should provide new challenges to both the robbers and police with a greater emphasis on strategy and communication.
<br>
<br>
[IMG size="3440x1440"]https://files.perpheads.com/wC4xcPfTVIgJY4Cg.jpg[/IMG]<br>
[LIST]
[*]Added new lighting and sound effects to the bank when the alarm triggers
[*]The front entrances of the bank and all windows will now be shuttered closed when the alarm triggers
[*]Restricted the bank robbery area to within the bank itself
[*]Added escape tunnel with multiple exits usable after opening the vault door
[LIST]
[*]The exit to the beach will need to be lockpicked by the robbers
[*][SPOILER="Escape Tunnel"][IMG size="3440x1440"]https://files.perpheads.com/dXswqTDu1ASfshnf.jpg[/IMG][/SPOILER]
[/LIST]
<br>
<br>
[B][SIZE=7]Weather & Seasons[/SIZE][/B]<br>
The weather system has received a massive overhaul and is being reintroduced with V6. The visual effects have been completely redone to both look and perform better and are accompanied by new (more satisfying) sound effects. Along with this, a new seasons system has been added which will adjust the textures and models of the map's foliage throughout the in-game year. Together these changes should make the map feel much more alive and dynamic.

<br>
[B][SIZE=7]Interactive Map[/SIZE][/B]<br>
A new map is being intoduced at [URL]https://www.paralakev6.com/map[/URL].  This new interactive web map will allow you to get a better understanding of the layout for V6, as it contains information on all the key locations.  The mugging map has also been integrated into it, instead of being an image on help.perpheads.com.  On top of this you can also find other layers, such as street names and property boundaries.  To switch between layers, click the button in the bottom right of the page.
<br>
<br>
Further layers and information will be added to the map in the future.

[B][SIZE=7]New Vehicle[/SIZE][/B]<br>
Alongside the new map, we are introducing a the new BearCat to replace the old TFU Brute.
